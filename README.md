## 🧭 About Me
I’m a mathematics major who believes in the power of combining math and code to create intelligent systems.  
After diving into AI using Python and Keras, I found joy in turning abstract theory into something concrete, useful, and potentially profitable.

Right now, I’m building a strong foundation in:
- Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics, Differential Equations
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning fundamentals

My long-term goal is to **develop AI systems that push boundaries**—whether in research, real-world applications, or entrepreneurship.
